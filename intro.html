design and development. Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge of programming languages, algorithms, and <br>
data structures while working on projects that challenge and enhance my coding abilities.</p>

<p>Alongside my academic pursuits, I am an aspiring software designer, focusing on creating intuitive, efficient,
and user-friendly applications.<br> I am particularly interested in designing software solutions that solve real-world problems,
improve user experiences, and leverage the latest technologies.</p>

My hobbies allow me to think outside the box and bring fresh perspectives to both my studies and projects.</p>

<p>I'm constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and best practices to improve my skills,
 and I’m eager to collaborate on exciting projects<br>
